# Contributing

This project is still being actively developed and contributors are always welcome!
Check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/srhickma/padd) if you would like to contribute, have any issues, or
are curious about the implementation.

Specification contributions are welcome as well.
The [test specifications](https://github.com/srhickma/padd/tree/master/tests/spec) in the project source are useful for
testing the project, but are more-so intended as sample specifications which are fully functional for many languages,
and can be modified to suit the needs of specific users.
If there is a language you use which you do not see listed, please consider contributing your own specification.
If it was useful to you it will surely be useful for others as well!
